Problem Statement 
What will happen if you try to compile and run this? 
public class Test{ 
static{ 
print(10); 
} 
static void print (int x) { 
System.out.println (x); 
System.exit(0); 
} 
}


I notice that the main function is missing. This program would compile but then during runtime it will not be able to and will fail mentioning main is missing.
